New feature to allow creating Product Collections and saving products to those collections. This feature provides the ability for users to create one or multiple Product Collections of favorite or "wish list" products.
- Use of this feature is restricted to buyer users.
- A maximum of 500 products can be added to a Product Collection.
- Products returned via `GET v1/me/productcollections/{productCollectionID}/products` are still subject to [visibility requirements](https://ordercloud.io/knowledge-base/product-visibility).

## New Resource `ProductCollection`
```json
{
    "ID": "MyFavoriteProducts",
    "Name": "My Favorite Products",
    "xp": {}
}
```
