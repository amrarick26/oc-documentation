New feature to allow tracking of product inventory across multiple locations. 

## New Resource: `InventoryRecord`

```json
"InventoryRecord" : {
  "ID": "",
  "OwnerID": "",
  "AddressID": "",
  "Address": {...}, //read-only Address object
  "OrderCanExceed": false,
  "QuantityAvailable": 0,
  "LastUpdated": "2022-01-04T00:00:00.00+00:00",
  "xp": {}
}
```

The `InventoryRecord` resource exists only in the context of a given Product, and can be extended to Product Variants.
- The ID property is writable and follows the same convention as all other [writable IDs](https://ordercloud.io/learn/ordercloud-basics/conventions#writeable-ids) in OrderCloud.
- The `OwnerID` property is writable only by the Marketplace Owner. Otherwise this ID reflects the Supplier that created the Inventory Record.
- The `Product.Inventory` object will remain on the Product resource, even if Inventory Records are associated with the given Product.
   - If any InventoryRecords exist for a product, `Product.Inventory.QuantityAvailable` will be the derived sum of all `InventoryRecord.QuantityAvailable`.  If you write to it, the value will never be returned unless all InventoryRecords are deleted.
- `Address` is a read-only object derived from the `AddressID` given.
- Multiple InventoryRecords for the same Product/Address combination are allowed. This can be useful if you need to track different inventory levels for different fulfillment methods.
- The `AddressID` used to create an `InventoryRecord` must be owned by the `OwnerID`.
- InventoryRecords are not returned on the Product resource; however, you can use filters on InventoryRecord information in product queries, e.g. `v1/me/products?InventoryRecord.AddressID={address1}|{address2}&InventoryRecord.QuantityAvailable=>5`.

## New Endpoints 

Products
- `GET v1/products/{productID}/inventoryrecords`
- `GET v1/products/{productID}/inventoryrecords/{inventoryRecordID}`
- `POST v1/products/{productID}/inventoryrecords`
- `PUT v1/products/{productID}/inventoryrecords/{inventoryRecordID}`
- `PATCH v1/products/{productID}/inventoryrecords/{inventoryRecordID}`
- `DELETE v1/products/{productID}/inventoryrecords/{inventoryRecordID}`

Variants
- `GET v1/products/{productID}/variants/{variantID}/inventoryrecords`
- `GET v1/products/{productID}/variants/{variantID}/inventoryrecords/{inventoryRecordID}`
- `POST v1/products/{productID}/variants/{variantID}/inventoryrecords`
- `PUT v1/products/{productID}/variants/{variantID}/inventoryrecords/{inventoryRecordID}`
- `PATCH v1/products/{productID}/variants/{variantID}/inventoryrecords/{inventoryRecordID}`
- `DELETE v1/products/{productID}/variants/{variantID}/inventoryrecords/{inventoryRecordID}`

## New Property
 `LineItem.InventoryRecordID`
- Only writable prior to submitting an order
- References the `InventoryRecord` that will be decremented on submit.
- If using Inventory Records for a given Product, you must provide an `InventoryRecordID` on the `LineItem` in order to track inventory. If any Inventory Records exist for a Product on a `LineItem` where `InventoryRecordID` is null, no inventory will be decremented on order submit.
