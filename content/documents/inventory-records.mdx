New feature to allow tracking of product inventory across multiple locations.

## New Product Resource: `InventoryRecord`
```json
"InventoryRecord" : {
    "ID": "Minneapolis",
    "OwnerID": "MarketplaceOwnerID",
	"AddressID": "MinneapolisRetail",
	"Address": {
			"ID": "MinneapolisRetail",
			"DateCreated": "2021-10-06T14:05:09.48+00:00",
			"CompanyName": "Minneapolis Retail",
			"FirstName": null,
			"LastName": null,
			"Street1": "110 N 5th Street",
			"Street2": null,
			"City": "Minneapolis",
			"State": "MN",
			"Zip": "55403",
			"Country": "US",
			"Phone": null,
			"AddressName": "Minneapolis Retail",
			"xp": {}
		}, 
	"OrderCanExceed": false,
	"QuantityAvailable": 10,
	"LastUpdated": "2021-10-06T14:05:09.48+00:00",
	"xp": {}
}
```
The `InventoryRecord` resource exists only in the context of a given Product, and can be extended for Product Variants. If any Inventory Records exist for a product, `Product.Inventory.QuantityAvailable` becomes read-only and will reflect the sum of all `InventoryRecord.QuantityAvailable`. 
- The ID property is writable and follows the same convention as all other [writable IDs](https://ordercloud.io/learn/ordercloud-basics/conventions#writeable-ids) in OrderCloud. 
- The `OwnerID` property is writable only by the Marketplace Owner. Otherwise this ID reflects the Supplier that created the Inventory Record.
- The `Product.Inventory` object will remain on the Product resource, even if Inventory Records are associated with the given Product. 
- Address is a read only object derived from the AddressID given. 
- The Address used to create an Inventory Record must be owned by the OwnerID. 


## New Endpoints
### Products
- `GET v1/products/{productID}/inventorylocations`
- `GET v1/products/{productID}/inventorylocations/{inventoryLocationID}`
- `POST v1/products/{productID}/inventorylocations`
- `PUT v1/products/{productID}/inventorylocations/{inventoryLocationID}`
- `PATCH v1/products/{productID}/inventorylocations/{inventoryLocationID}`
- `DELETE v1/products/{productID}/inventorylocations/{inventoryLocationID}`
### Variants
- `GET v1/products/{productID}/variants/{variantID}/inventorylocations`
- `GET v1/products/{productID}/variants/{variantID}/inventorylocations/{inventoryLocationID}`
- `POST v1/products/{productID}/variants/{variantID}/inventorylocations`
- `PUT v1/products/{productID}/variants/{variantID}/inventorylocations/{inventoryLocationID}`
- `PATCH v1/products/{productID}/variants/{variantID}/inventorylocations/{inventoryLocationID}`
- `DELETE v1/products/{productID}/variants/{variantID}/inventorylocations/{inventoryLocationID}`

## New Properties
`LineItem.InventoryRecordID`  
- Only writable prior to submitting an order.
- References the Inventory Record that will be decremented on submit.
- If using Inventory Records for a given Product, you must provide an InventoryRecordID on the Line Item in order to track inventory. If any Inventory Records exist for a Product of a Line Item where `InventoryRecordID` is null, no inventory will be decrement on order submit.
