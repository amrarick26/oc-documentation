In today's e-commerce market, subscriptions have become a popular business model for one simple reason: convenience. 
They enable a regular, predictable delivery of goods or services with little to no effort from the customer. Subscriptions also foster a greater brand loyalty 
from your customer base, providing more long term value.

The introduction of Subscriptions in OrderCloud enables automated ordering for buyer users on a set interval and frequency for a predetermined or indefinite amount of time.
This feature depends on the implementation of the Subscription Integration in order to submit orders. 

## Use Cases
- I sell consumable goods that my customers can either order on set schedule they define based on their needs or on an as needed basis 
- My product is a subscription based service/digital membership that I charge for monthly
- My product is a collection of goods that are either standardized or customized for the user that is delivered on a set interval

## Key Highlights
- Set the interval and frequency on the subscription to determine how often the items are ordered 
- Store payment information to be used for processing the `Subscription`
- Optional EndDate to allow `Subscriptions` to be processed indefinitely
- There is no limit on how many `Subscriptions` a buyer user can have
- Seller users can create `Subscriptions` on behalf of buyer users
- Only products that are visible to the Subscription.FromUserID will be created as line items at the time the subscription order is created

## New Resource: `Subscription`

```json
"Subscription": {
    "ID": "subscription1",
    "Interval": Daily, Weekly, or Monthly,
