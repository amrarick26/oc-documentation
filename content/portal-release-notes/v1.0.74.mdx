### Support for OrderCloud Regions
The OrderCloud Portal now provides the ability to manage marketplaces across multiple teams. Read more about [OrderCloud Regions here](/knowledge-base/ordercloud-regions)

### New Features
- `me/regions` - A new **Portal endpoint** for listing available regions
- Creating a new marketplace now requires a `Marketplace.Region.Id` property. This value can be derived from the `me/regions` response.
- Marketplaces can now be sorted and filtered on by `Region.Id`
- The Marketplace > Settings view now provides more detailed information about which OrderCloud API Instance should be used.
