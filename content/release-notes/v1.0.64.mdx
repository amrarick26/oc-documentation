_Released to Production on Monday, October 30th, 2017_

## New Features

- We now allow `lineitems` of _unsubmitted_ `Orders` to be added to a `Shipment`. This does not apply to the [`ship all` endpoint](/api-reference/orders-and-fulfillment/orders/ship).
- There is a new endpoint that allows a `buyer user` to be transferred from one buyer to another, within the same organization. Please check out the [documentation](/api-reference/buyers/users/move) for further details.
  - please note, this should only be attempted by an `admin user` in a seller application. If a buyer user, even one with `Full Access`, tries this, it will not work as expected.
