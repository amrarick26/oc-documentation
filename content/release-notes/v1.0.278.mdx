- Rule engine enhancement that allows rule engine expressions to check on an array items. The following methods are supported: 'contains', 'count', 'all', 'any'. You can find all the details about the feature [here](/knowledge-base/rule-based-promotion-expressions).
- OIDC now supports a response_mode of form_post from IDPs. We recommended this configuration for anyone using Azure as their IDP as their authorization codes have [increased in size](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad/azure-ad-b2c-authorization-code-and-refresh-token-size-increase/m-p/3770890), and are no longer able to be handled properly as query parameters.
